      <h2>3D contour creation from annotations</h2>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>

    <p>
      3D contour creations may be constructed from polygon annotations and superimposed on existing brain images. Prior to
      creating them, you will need to create polygon annotations around the region of interest (ROI). To create more accurate
      3D structures, you should create polygons with many vertices, especially around edges.

      <h3>Process and example </h3>
      <h4>Create annotations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Login to brainsharer.org Admin page (upper right-hand corner of page):</li>
        <img alt="Brainsharer login part 1" src="/assets/polygons.1.login.png" />
        <li>After login, go back to login area and select ‘Admin’</li>
        <img alt="Brainsharer login part 2" src="/assets/polygons.2.login.png" />
        <li>In the admin portal, navigate to the Neuroglancer section and select ‘Neuroglancer states’</li>
        <img alt="Brainsharer navigate" src="/assets/polygons.3.navigate.png" />
        <li>Use top search tool to locate Neuroglancer states by typing brain name (animal id):</li>
        <img alt="Brainsharer search" src="/assets/polygons.4.search.png" />
        <li>Click on link in ‘Neuroglancer’ column to open this brain state in Neuroglancer (smaller box in figure above)
        </li>
        <li>Create polygons on the sections that contain cytoarchitecture artifacts of interest. 
          Polygon creation is described on: https://webdev.dk.ucsd.edu/docs/brainsharer/neuroglancer/modules/polygon_tool.html
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Previw and save annotations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Once the polygons are created with sufficient detail, go to the layer (top tabs) where they are listed and 
          select ‘Annotations’ subtab (upper-right corner of screen):</li>
        <img alt="Brainsharer annotations" src="/assets/polygons.5.annotations.png" />
        <li>Select annotation set of interest. in figure above, TG_L is selected. When you roll your mouse cursor over the 
          annotation set that contains the polygons to be used for the 3D contour creation, 
          you may see an arrow icon (pointing down) to represent that this annotation set may be used for creating a 3D contour.</li>
        <img alt="Brainsharer select annotation" src="/assets/polygons.6.select.annotation.png" />
        <p>Note: If this icon does not appear, you will need to triage just those polygons from larger ‘Neuroglancer state’. 
          This is accomplished by creating a new annotation set in database through the following steps: 1) with polygons selected 
          in top panel, click on ‘new’ button in lower panel. 2) A notification in lower-left will indicate when the creation is complete.
        </p>
        <img alt="Brainsharer selection info" src="/assets/polygons.7.selection.info.png" />
      </ul>
      <h4>Generate 3D mesh/contour view</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Returning to upper-right annotations panel, click the arrow icon (pointing down). 
          This will generate a 3D view of the stacked polygons, using interpolation. Notification in lower-left will say ‘creating 3d mesh’.</li>
        <p>Note: A new layer tab will appear at top, next to existing annotation/image tabs. This segmentation layer will have the new 3D contour/mesh.
        </p>
        <li>To view the 3D contour/mesh in display panels, you will need to toggle visibility. 
          To accomplish this, select ‘Seg.’ tab in upper part of the new 3D contour layer. 
          Below selection, you will see a cross-out eye icon which must be clicked to show the 3D contour/mesh.
        </li>
        <img alt="Brainsharer view" src="/assets/polygons.8.view.png" />
        <p>Note: You may wish view multiple overlays on a single region of interest. For better visibility, you may adjust opacity of annotations and/or contours. 
          For the contour/mesh volumes, the adjustments may be found on the ‘Render’ tab. The settings that affect contours are the ones ending in ‘3d’.
        </p>
